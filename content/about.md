# About
I am interested in developing algorithms that learn from streaming data and adapt to changes in the environment.

- [Detecting toxic flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05827) @ arXiv 2023 (preprint)
- [Low-rank extended Kalman filtering for online learning of neural networks from streaming data](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v232/chang23a.html) @ CoLLAs 2023
- [Efficient online Bayesian inference for neural bandits](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v151/duran-martin22a.html) @ AiStats 2022
